The purpose of this challenge is to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application (Flask) to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
